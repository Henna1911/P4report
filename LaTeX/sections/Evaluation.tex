\subsection{Evaluation Plan}

When conducting this user test, it is the intention to get some data from the users about the different effects and gestures. 
Initially, the users are asked to sign a consent form, see Appendix \ref{Consent} and \ref{Script} for script and consent form. They are then told to put on the glove and try to apply the effects. Afterwards, they are then asked to answer a questionnaire, see Appendix \ref{Questionnaire}.
