\chapter{Implementation}

The following chapter describes how the protoype has been implemented and the materials needed to build the prototype. 

\subsection{Hardware}

The prototype consists of an Arduino Mega 2560\citep{Arduino}, which is connected to a circuit board with an inertial measurement unit(IMU). 
The IMU uses the MPU 9150 sensor with 9 degrees of freedom\citep{MPU}. It has a tri-axis gyroscope, magnetometer, and accelorometer.

\subsection{Schematic} 

The following figure \ref{schematic} shows how the Arduino is connected to the circuit board with the IMU.

The circuit board consists of three LEDs, a yellow, green and red. They light up at different points, which is explained in the next section of this chapter.
The LEDs are connected to resistors of 220 ohm which is wired to the arduino as seen in the schematic.
